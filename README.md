Alarm-Clock
===========

This is an old project of mine. I've used this application for a few years now and it always works properly.

I haven't felt the need to update it either. I have built a replacement in Java to be able to use it in Linux as well (https://github.com/m1dnight/JAlarm).

There is currently a fork going round which has improvements over mine: https://github.com/joshmaines/WUCA-Alarm-Clock
